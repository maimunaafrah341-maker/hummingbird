"""
Push the alert outward: the SMS / Telegram / Slack leg of an incident.

Nothing here talks to a real carrier or a real workspace. It builds the
payload each channel would receive and POSTs the lot to one endpoint --
a webhook.site URL, or the stub in this file. That is the honest shape
for a hackathon: the dispatch decision, the per-channel formatting and
the delivery report are all real, and only the last hop is simulated.
Swapping in Twilio or a Slack webhook later means changing the URL and
the transport, not the logic.

Per-channel formatting is not decoration. An SMS is hard-limited to 160
characters and a truncated safety instruction is a dangerous artifact,
so the SMS body is built to fit and says so when it had to cut.

There is a receiver in here too, so the whole path can be exercised
with no external service and no network:

    python webhook_dispatch.py --serve 8899        # terminal 1
    python webhook_dispatch.py --demo --url http://127.0.0.1:8899

Run it:

    python webhook_dispatch.py --demo --url https://webhook.site/<your-uuid>
    python webhook_dispatch.py --selftest          # spins its own stub
